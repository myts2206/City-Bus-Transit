# Bus Transit Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bus transit data to understand scheduling patterns, trip delays, and overall performance metrics. The primary objective is to gain insights into bus operations, detect inefficiencies, and suggest improvements in scheduling and traffic management. The dataset includes real-world bus tracking information and Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) records.

## Project Details
The analysis involves multiple stages:

1. **Data Loading**: The datasets are loaded from CSV files and checked for consistency.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, converting timestamps, and extracting relevant features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and delay categories are derived.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques are used to explore patterns in bus delays, route efficiencies, and peak traffic times.
5. **Delay Analysis**: Statistical methods are applied to study trip delays and identify key influencing factors.
6. **Modeling (Optional)**: Machine learning models can be implemented to predict delays based on historical data.

The insights from this analysis can help optimize bus schedules, reduce delays, and improve urban transportation planning.
